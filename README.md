This project was a recrutment task in one of the software houses. I've made it in Reac + TS based on provided wireframes in guidelines.

# The main assumptions 
1. React + TypeScript
2. Creating app ready to develop in the future
    a. Using styled-components for styling (+ take care about RWD)
    b. Atomic desing for components
3. List component just for initial render - whole logic for changing statuses should be on list item level
4. Provide 1:1 UI from the invision project
